          ol
            li It’s against the law in Ontario to dig without having natural gas lines located.

            li Damage to these pipes or wires could create a safety hazard or shut down service to an entire neighbourhood until the system is repaired. 
            li Business owners or their contractors are liable for damages, which could include a costly lawsuit if personal injury or property damage result. 
            li Contact Ontario One Call at <a href="http://on1call.com" target="_blank">on1call.com</a> or toll free at <strong>1-800-400-2255</strong>.

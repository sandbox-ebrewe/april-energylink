            strong 1. What is cap and trade?
            br
            | The provincial government’s cap-and-trade program, which started on Jan. 1, 2017, sets a target to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ontario. Union Gas is required to buy emission allowances for the natural gas you use, and those costs are recovered on your bill. The government plans to use the funds raised by this program to support Ontario’s Climate Change Action Plan. Visit <a href="uniongas.com/capandtrade">uniongas.com/capandtrade</a> to learn more.

            strong 2. How much will cap and trade increase my bill?
            br
            | The current cost of GHG emission allowances – about 3.3 cents per cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>) of natural gas used – is included in the Delivery line on your bill. The price of emission allowances can change over time, but the Ontario Energy Board must approve all costs before they’re charged to you. By using the calculator found at <a href="uniongas.com/capandtrade">uniongas.com/capandtrade</a>, you can estimate what cap and trade is costing you.

            strong 3. What can I do to reduce the cost?
            br
            | The amount you’ll pay for cap and trade depends on the amount of gas you use. Union Gas has effi ciency programs and simple tips to help you reduce your gas use and lower your overall energy costs along with the costs of cap and trade.
